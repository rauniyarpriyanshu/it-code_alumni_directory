# About the data set

`I have used data set in csv format in my app just like I was provided as demonstration from IT code challenge. I have used local storage to store and retrieve data from asset folder to local device storage, so any changes made in data will remain in the device and will not be acessible to all other users. This is just for demonstration purpose.`


`Note`: This version is currently designed for XL, XXL Screen Size so if you try to use this app on lower screen density then you might experience UI issue.
